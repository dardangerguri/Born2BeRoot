# Born2BeRoot

The Born2beroot project at Hive (42 school) is an immersive learning experience in system administration. Through this project, we will learn how to:

- Install and configure a virtual machine
- Explore virtualization technologies
- Learn about partitioning schemes
- Gain proficiency in Logical Volume Management (LVM)
- Master command-line software for system administration
- Understand secure protocols like SSH
- Appreciate the importance of system security through sudo, firewalls, and password policies

By completing this project, we develop essential skills and knowledge to excel in system administration.

[`Born2BeRoot`](Born2BeRoot.md) covers most of the topics and tools, I expolored during this project!
